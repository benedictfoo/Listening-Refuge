## Friends Of Mine

This song feels like a message of encouragement for friends in need. The
slow-tempo, soft piano, and gentle, steady singing
give ample breathing space for reflection and somber, empathetic mood.

In the first verse, the singer is aware of the suffering his friend is in and sings: *"keep your eyes on the horizon"*.
He
also understands that still, *"it gets hard to keep on rising"* sometimes.

The emotional chorus, with soft vocal harmonies, acknowledges that everyone faces unexpected difficulties and undeserved
hardships: *"the wind blows
the rain in your eyes"*. But he also affirms his friends' worth and offers words of encouragement: *"I see your cup
filled with kindness, raise you a glass full of wine. Take courage, friends of mine"*.

The second verse with added vocal harmonies, deepens the emotional weight of the struggle we all face. It reminds us we
should care for others because we understand how we would want our friends to do the same for us.

The second chorus adds a soulful guitar section to highlight the delicate, caring feelings for his friends.

The bridge is especially touching, as the lyrics express how he stands by his friends. This is made even more impactful
with
the steady
vocal harmonies, light guitars, and soft, gentle drums.

This then leads to the concluding guitar solo, tender and emotional. The singer sends the song with
the line from the chorus: *"I see your cup
filled with kindness, raise you a glass full of wine. Take courage, friends of mine".

This song reminds me of the importance of having a strong circle, not necessarily friends but perhaps family too. We all
need
comfort and support sometimes, but it is equally important to care for friends around us.

It also made me think of times I added stress to my loved ones, when I feel unhappy and started to quarrel. I hope that
you won't make the same mistake I made ðŸ˜³. But I guess from today onwards, I can do better...

Take care, friends of mine.
