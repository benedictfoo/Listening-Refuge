## Song Overview

This song is an encouragement for those facing struggles or pain in life. The singer understands that sometimes life
gets rather tough, making it hard for us to bear it all. Also, He seems to have written this song for a particular
friend: one who has led a life of kindness. He urges them to stand tall and rise back up.

## Lyrics I love

> Everyone knows that in life sometimes
>
> The wind blows the rain in your eyes
>
> I see your cup filled with kindness
>
> Raise you a glass full of wine
>
> Take courage friends of mine

This is the chorus. We all have had dull, depressing stuff in life, despite doing our best to do the right things. The
singer encourages his friend to take courage.

> It's a crazy world
>
> We're all trying to live in
>
> We all feel alone and afraid

The singer seems to encourage his friend by saying loneliness and fear are universal feelings. It is comforting to hear
that we are all in this together.

> Be in the moment
>
> Find the strength not to give in
>
>And we'll sail on to better days

He offers advice for his friend to focus on now, and not give in to anything unhelpful. We will have better days ahead.

## What I love about the music

The song begins only with keyboards. The keyboard playing is warm and slow. It prepares me to sit back and relax.

The singer’s vocals join shortly after. I can hear the singer’s sincerity and empathy for his friend, and it brings
feelings of hope and courage to me.

The drums, bass, and guitar only come after the first chorus. This makes the following lines more impactful than before.
It particularly makes the next chorus sound more emotional and yet uplifting.

The guitar solo near the end continues, making the song feel really touching, and brings the song to an end, where I
felt at peace and rested.

## Conclusion

This song is really calming and helps me stay grounded. As I am writing this, it is midnight, and I feel like this song
is perfect for times when I am just focusing on tasks and want something motivational and peaceful to listen to. I would
like to be a source of comfort to my friends when the time arises.
