## Ain't No Man

Intro's catchy bass line with percussion and clapping, caught my attention. I almost stopped listening to the song
when I heard from the first line: *"ain't no man can save me"* followed by: *"can enslave me"*. My first thought, oddly
enough was that they might be denouncing faith in Jesus, who is both God and Man. Even so, I listened for a bit longer
and realized they were talking about people not God or someone specific. I know, it is funny how the mind sometimes can
think
weird and nonsensical things.

The overall vibe of the song feels empowering and I enjoyed the simple rhythms created by the sturdy bass line,
percussion and clapping from the intro. It makes me want to get up and dance. The lyrics make me feel like we have a
choice: whether we want to be affected by others, or we could believe in ourselves and do what we need to survive
and thrive and flourish.

Many times in the past â€” until quite recently, I used to get affected by the smallest things people said or did. But
over time, I
came to
the
realization that we are not living for likes or others' expectations. We should just be ourselves and focus on
living our lives. Life is short enough as it is. I believe we should enjoy life and be free â€” free from fear and worry.

And that is what I thought the song was speaking about. Sorry if I am a little preachy there. I just find this song
could be my theme song somehow, cos it resonates with me a lot. Just thought Iâ€™d share what this song meant to me.

Thanks for reading. I hope you enjoyed it! ðŸŒž
