## Kings of Convenience—Rocky Trail

The song opens with vibrant violin melodies, supported by soft guitar strumming, creating a
chill atmosphere that's perfect for unwinding on a weekend. The theme centers on the importance of expressing
one's troubles and the feelings that arise from them.

He reaches out to a friend he had a falling out with, to try and reconcile. He explains that he assumed
his friend was strong
enough to handle whatever challenges he faced: *"Almost anything you can imagine, almost any goal, you will get there"*.
The way he sings it and the words chosen make me feel at ease: as if he was talking to a friend.

He reflects: *"Maybe you could have told me there was a world on your shoulders that needed lifting. Maybe I could have
helped you with that"*. He was willing to help, but he simply didn't know his friend needed support.
*"How am I to know about your problems and your load?
I am blind to what you show, I am waiting to be told.
I never ask"*

It feels like both sides could have communicated better. His friend could have been more vocal about his struggles,
while
the
singer could have reached out more or asked what went wrong when their relationship began to drift. Who knows what
reasons held them back? Are those reasons really more important than the friendship itself? Something that might matter
more in the long run? Why let misunderstandings linger for weeks, months, or even years before trying to reconnect?

This is what I felt about the song. Great message, and it is a really comfy song. I enjoyed it a lot, and hope you would
too.
