Song overview
-------------

This song is about the singer and his relationship with a friend whom he considers to be exceptional and highly capable.
The singer had been unaware that his friend was having some difficulties, which led their relationship to sour a little.
This song highlights the importance of communication in relationships.

Even though their relationship has turned for the
worse, the singer looks at the whole situation in a positive light, and the music definitely follows the same vibe, with
its chill, happy instrumentation.

Lyrics I love
-------------

> One more time
>
> Let's say you give me one more time
>
> One last chance to speak again
>
> Let's start from what we left unsaid
>
> And here we go

The singer seemingly had some fallout with someone — a friend, lover, or family member. Let’s just call them a friend.
He wants to speak with them to make things right. Some words were meant to be said, but he hasn’t done it yet.

> Brave enough to go climbing a wall
>
> So high that no sunlight is seen through winter
>
> Brave enough to go traveling around the world
>
> Without money to eat or sleep for

I like the repetition of the word “brave” twice. It emphasizes the tenacity his friend has ito reach their goals.

> Seeing what you can do with your hands and feet
>
> I feel there is no question about it
>
> Almost anything you can imagine
>
> Almost any goal, you will get there

His friend is capable, and the singer does not doubt that his friend will succeed in what they do. I can feel the
admiration he has for his friend. Even with the state of their relationship, he has to say what is good about his
friend.

> Maybe you could have told me
>
> Thеre was a world on your shoulders that needed lifting
>
> Maybe I could have helped you with that
>

His friend was having some trouble he didn’t know of. Could the misunderstandings have started from here? Perhaps his
friend thought the singer didn’t care for them. But in fact, the singer didn’t mean to do that.

> How am I to know about your problems and your load?
>
> I am blind to what you show
>
> I am waiting to be told
>
> I never ask

Sometimes, I can’t see the situation clearly, even when it is right in front of me. The singer explains that he didn’t
notice that his friend needed help.

I feel like both sides could have done better. But I think the singer is more
responsible for what has happened. I find that the singer could have said more and asked more when his friend was
feeling unhappy, instead of avoiding conflict.

What I love about the music
---------------------------

I like that the intro of the song starts without vocals. It begins with violins, percussion, and guitars with a bossa
nova feel, and is very chill and uplifting. Two vocals join in soon after with one harmonizing over the other in a
soothing way.

The singing is heartfelt when he is trying to reconcile with his friend. He seems to be happy when
recalling how he felt his friend could reach any goal he wanted. He honestly was happy for them, because he felt his
friend was doing well.

There is slight frustration in the voice when he is ‘complaining’ that his friend should have
vocalized if he needed a hand.

However, the song doesn't seem to stress me out despite that. The conflict being explained in a light-hearted, gentle
manner,
puts me at ease.

Conclusion
----------

My main takeaway from this song is that communication solves many relationship problems.

This song makes me happy and
lifts some burdens from my life. It makes me feel like some problems with people are rather simple, and we can just
humble ourselves and take the first step to solve the problem. I am sure with honesty and gentleness and humility, many
of these
problems can be handled well.
