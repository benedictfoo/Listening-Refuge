Song Introduction
-----------------

Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker? **Silver in the Blue** depicts the chosen path taken by the
Atlantic salmon, guided by nature back to its birthing place, which I know from research, is to spawn a new generation.
I want to share my feelings and thoughts on this song with you. Right now. I will begin with the lyrics first.

Lyrics I love the most
----------------------

> Silver in the blue
>
> The pull of northern latitudes
>
> Guided by Earth and Moon
>
> But the lines are fading

We can see that the salmon are guided by nature, and the environment changes and demands that the salmon follow a
certain path. It evokes a sense of calm for the salmon, because nature is like its master and knows how to guide the
salmon on its path, the salmon can just do as it could.

> From the source, you drift back to a future time
>
>At the shore, you must turn and face the tide
>
>That moves you

**Drifting back to a future time** suggests a cycle as they reach back to their original place and birth new fry.

They
must face harsh tides as they move onto the shore. I imagine it is a life or death situation; they could either pass
this shore or stay stuck, and their journey ends.

I think we would like to think that nature is perfect and life should
be smooth-sailing, but the fact is that sometimes tough situations are normal and life does have its unique challenges
too. And that is okay.

> To other worlds you go
>
> A thousand miles from these shores

This is part of the song’s bridge. It says that the journey is long and vast: it makes me feel a sense of awe at the
length the salmon take based on nature’s guidance. It is amazing, really.

What these lyrics make me feel
------------------------------

It feels good to be under the guidance of a master, seemingly, because danger and obstacles can be part of the plan of a
Greater Being. If you believe in a God or Creator, you will understand this.

Regardless of whether you believe in a
Maker, as humans, we do have more control over our actions, as compared to animals. So, while we all have different
circumstances, we have the capability to make choices to change our situations.

Finally, What I enjoyed and felt about the music of the song
------------------------------------------------------------

I really felt peaceful when listening to this song.

Julie Fowlis usually sings in Gaelic, so her singing in English is
quite rare, haha! Her voice, together with some soft male harmonies, here evokes a peaceful, spiritual feeling, the kind
that feels like one(the salmon) is under the watch and control of a Maker.

The two guitars' soft emotional strumming
adds to the feeling of peace. I could feel my breathing slowing down, and time seemed to slow down.

Together with Julie Fowlis’ marvelous vocals and other vocal harmonies, there is a tinge of sadness in the song, for the
salmon, cause the
salmon do actually really have a hard time.

The percussion and bass sound warm and gentle. It calmly and steadily celebrates the
journey of the salmon with the challenges it faces. It added a different layer of peace and stability to the song as a
whole. I like that they get louder around the bridge, which feels like the apex of the salmon’s journey, where it is
most challenging.

One last thing is the little sound effects that appear frequently, which could signify the constant
changes around the salmon‘s environment. It sounds calming too, cause it is soft and dreamy, and makes me feel
accustomed to the changes the salmon is experiencing.

Conclusion
----------

I hope this song helps those who feel like they are having a hard time. Don’t worry, take things slowly, you will be
alright.
