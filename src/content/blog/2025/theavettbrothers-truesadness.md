## True Sadness

“True Sadness,” the title track of The Avett Brothers’ 2016 album, reveals a narrator who has suffered deeply, found
redemption, and realized that suffering is a universal part of being human.

The song opens with offbeat syncopated drums that immediately grab the listener's attention. Soon, short, quick guitar
strumming joins in, adding a rhythm distinct from the drums. As the vocals join, they bring a more regular cadence
alongside the drums, and the guitars shift to a longer, steadier rhythm. Altogether, this makes the song feel lively and
welcoming, even as it moves into weighty emotional territory.

The narrator begins with gratitude — he recalls a friend who helped him unconditionally during a time of deep personal
struggle. His friend was a light in a season of darkness. He had faced internal chaos and pain, but the kindness of a
friend helped him find redemption.

In the chorus, even though he got better, he still gets "shaken up by dreams." He realizes that "no one is fine." The
line _"Take the time to peel a few layers, and you will find true sadness,"_ is a call for empathy. Everyone has their
unique challenges.

He opens up about his alcohol addiction — something that began in childhood and lingered into adulthood. His friend was
_"the real deal in a world of imposters"_ — this line lightly warns that we need to be careful who we trust. There are
people in the world offering false promises.

The chorus repeats.

Then, the song introduces Angela, a fictional character who becomes a target of objectification. The narrator speaks up
on her behalf: she is more than how the world sees her — more than beauty or physical appeal. She has dreams, feelings,
and dignity. Her story broadens the theme of sadness: it’s not only internal, but also caused by the evil and harm that
exists around — and within — us.

The narrator admits there is also evil in him innately and everywhere around him, and he needs to depend on a higher
power for strength to continue overcoming challenges and struggles: _"Just know the kingdom of God is within you even
though the battle is bound to continue."_

In the final chorus, the phrase “true sadness” repeats — not as a cry of despair, but as a quiet acceptance of what it
means to be human. And then, a beautiful fiddle solo closes the song with a feeling of celebration and peace.

All in all, I just want to say: suffering is universal — but not eternal. Redemption is possible, and we need to
practice compassion and not be the ones causing the hurt.

I feel empowered knowing I’m not alone in this. As a Christian, I take comfort in knowing that we can depend on God for
healing, renewal, and peace — even when true sadness lingers.

Whether or not you share my faith, I hope this song brings you comfort and reflection. I’d love to hear how you feel
about it!
