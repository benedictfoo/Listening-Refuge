## Black Pumas—Black Moon Rising

This song is quite memorable to me. I heard it during my journey of mental and emotional recovery. However, the song
means something different now than it did before.

The song starts with a drum fill- it sounds like one of those Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry sound effects. Then, swiftly
enters a slower, steadier soundscape of
tight, steady drums and soulful,
conviction-filled vocals, laid-back electric guitar, and clean melodic keyboard lines. The song then progresses with a
repeating melodic
string synth hook that sounds pleasant and, interestingly, tastefully retro. Together, the song as a whole evokes a
haunting, sombre atmosphere of passion and desire.

The song seems to be about a woman dressed in black who rises from the dead once every black moon, around every hundred
years. The man is obsessed with this woman and wants to be with her.
Is it wise to chase after such a person who appears only in such an unholy night? Is she even a person?

The man eagerly waits for the woman's appearance at any moment now. He is filled with ecstasy when she arrives. He
enjoys every moment around her, even as the song quietly fades away. Does the man fade away with the song, or is he
cursed to stay like this forever? Hopefully, the woman will disappear, and the man can continue with his life.

Years ago, when I first listened to it, I could relate to having strong desires for things-that was what drew me into
the song back then. It is exhilarating to chase after things that are unknown, mysterious, and full of boundless
possibilities.

However, recently this song felt different. It makes me feel sad because it reminds me of my past. I was walking down
paths with no destination, chasing the wrong things. I turned my life around when I let go of the wrong motivations and
focused on my growth as a better person.

Our desires are like a fire inside us. If we give in to harmful desires, it is as if we are pouring gasoline onto the
flame, and we will get burned. This song is a reminder to not be swayed by wrong desires.
