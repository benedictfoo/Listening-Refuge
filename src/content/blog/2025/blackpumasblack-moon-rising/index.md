## Song overview

This song has a dream-like quality to it. It seems to be about a fictional, tumultuous relationship between two people
that never ends.

The singer desires for the woman and goes about self-destructive behaviors just to please her. It always ends with the
woman’s rejection, and the man tries to win her back again, and the cycle continues.

## Lyrics I love

> Under the raging sun's open fire, fire, fire
>
> Ain't nothin' new, aint nothin' new
>
> We all have desires
>
> I want you to be my woman, babe
>
> Every time you get dressed in black
>
> You give a grown man a heart attack
>
> I pray that good Lord will bring you back
>
> You're my sunshine

The sun and its fire symbolize the man’s desire for the woman.

The singer says there ain’t nothin’ new under the sun. Everyone has desires.

He openly declares wanting to be with the woman.

He feels a rush every time he sees her dressed in black. Being dressed that way might suggest something sinister goes on
during these thrilling occasions.

And, he prays for the Lord to bring her into his life, cause she means the world to him.

> Shoot me down and break my heart
>
> It's the black moon rising, oh
>
> You brave the sight, I paint the picture
>
> And you wanna do it, oh
>
> 'Cause all she wants to do is cruise to black moon rising
>
> Right on, right on, baby, uh, cruise, oh

The chorus shows that there is a dark side to the relationship.

She eventually gets over the singer and leaves him. She sees the sorry state the man is in, and continues being away
from him. She just wants to get away from him.

> What's going on
>
> Same ol' thing just a different season
>
> 100 years and the only time she gets dressed in black
>
> Taking flight baby count you down
>
> On your way off without a sound
>
> Black moon rising above the clouds
>
> You're my sunshine

The cycle seems to go back to the beginning after some time. And the singer anticipates she will leave him once again.
Yet, he still chases after her.

## What I love about the music

This song is of the soul genre. The playful drum rolls start the song. Interestingly, this is a light-hearted motif
added to poke fun at the singer’s situation, which listeners will miss on first listen.

The synth, guitars, and drums have ample breathing space. The synth and guitars particularly add a mysterious and
curious flair to the music.

The verse represents the passion and perhaps self-destructive phase of the man in the relationship.

The chorus represents the bittersweet, painful phase when the woman leaves him.

The verse-chorus structure repeats once, followed by one more chorus to end the song. This creates a cycle where there
are ups and downs in the relationship. It ending on the down seems to imply that the down phase perhaps feels longer
than it is. I guess it makes sense because moments of loneliness and rejection do feel longer than they are.

## Conclusion

It is kind of horrifying that the relationship cycle can just repeat itself on a fresh slate.

I guess it is pointless to be stuck in such a cycle that doesn’t have a definite ending. But it does make sense that
many people do follow these types of cycles in life: be it in binge-restrict cycles in dieting or something else, like
relationships, games, or other vices.

We should be aware that chasing temporal things leads nowhere and focus on more
long-term goals.
