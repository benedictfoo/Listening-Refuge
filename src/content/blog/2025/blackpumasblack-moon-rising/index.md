## Black Pumas—Black Moon Rising

This is a memorable song I heard during my journey of mental and emotional recovery. It is one of the few songs that
have stuck with me over the past few years.

The song starts with a drum fill- it sounds like one of those Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry sound effects. I am not sure
what it is; it made me chuckle a bit and also caught my attention. Swiftly enters a slower, steadier soundscape of
tight, steady drums and soulful,
conviction-filled vocals, laid-back electric guitar, and keyboard. The song then progresses with a repeating melodic
string synth hook that sounds pleasant and, interestingly, tastefully retro. Together, the song as a whole evokes a
haunting, sombre atmosphere of passion and desire.

The song to me seems to be about a woman dressed in black who represents the object of the man's desire. She appears to
come back from the dead once every black moon, around every 100 years. Isn’t that rather creepy? What good could come
from meeting with such a person? The woman eventually breaks his heart. I assume she leaves after the black moon, so it
seems pointless to dedicate so much time to fleeting desires. But the man is so lost in his desires that he cannot think
badly of the situation he landed in. The man seems to be in a limbo, and just consumed with desire, with nothing else to
do

Years ago, when I first listened to it, I could relate to having strong desires for things-that was what drew me into
the song back then.

However, recently this song felt different. It makes me feel sad because it reminds me of succumbing to desire, wasting
so much precious time. It is really foolish, and I need to remind myself not to focus on things that bring fleeting
moments of good that won’t last and will bring us to ruin.

I would like to conclude with an interesting analogy I have heard recently. Our desires are like fire. If we succumb to
it, through our actions or thoughts, it is as if we are pouring gasoline onto the flame, and we will get burned.
