## Queen of Argyll

*A cover of the Silly Wizard's, same-titled song, with some lyrics modified, by Siobhan Miller in her latest album in
2022 – Bloom.*

The narrator, awe-struck and eager with a zealous passion, felt compelled to share, joyfully with everyone, a lady of "
character and feature", where no words could even barely manage to begin to describe her: the Queen of Argyll. This is
reflected in the gentle, clean, melodic acoustic guitars, tight, energetic percussions, and bright, cheery, emotional
piano chords.

He only has total respect and admiration for her. Her gracefulness and beauty, like a swan; her smile captivating and
genuine. Even the roses in the garden have to bow to her.

The whole of Argyll with its rich, large, and diverse population does not have anyone that could match her splendor.  
The fiddle solo, rather celebratory, fully brought forward the grandiosity and marvel fitting for her and her only.

Filled with genuine love and admiration for her, the narrator must leave the listeners and go find a way to court and
love her, respectfully and honorably. The song concludes here with a satisfying ending, with the fiddle melody again,
but more subtle, and the same percussive drums and some cymbals.

It is rather inspiring that one could be passionate about someone he has just met with such vigor. It evokes in me a
sense of admiration for the narrator – he is such a gentleman and has a genuine and sincere love for her. He is
determined to win her over and love her with honor and respect.

I really enjoyed this song. Siobhan Miller's cover was genuine and passionate – I rooted for the narrator and could
sense his passion and admiration for the Queen through the lyrics, instrumentation and vocals. I hope one day I can
develop such sincere feelings for someone, for something, or for some calling. Hope you enjoyed today's post as much as
I enjoyed deeply dwelling on and absorbing this song.
