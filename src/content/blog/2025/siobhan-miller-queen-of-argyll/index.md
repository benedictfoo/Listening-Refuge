## Song Overview

This is a cover of a Silly Wizard song. It is about a man’s admiration for an exceptional lady, which leads him to chase
after her in a respectable, honorable way.

## Lyrics I love

> The entire lyrics of the song have deep meaning, but I have decided to review only parts of it.
>
> Oh, good folks, it is my duty
>
> To inform you of one beauty
>
> Though I'd ask of you a favour
>
> Not to seek her for a while
>
> Though, I own she is a creature
>
> Of character and feature
>
> No words can paint the picture
>
> Of the queen of all Argyll

The man, amazed by what he saw, finds it necessary to share his discovery: a lady full of charm and beauty. No words
describe how amazing she is.

> And if you could have seen her there
>
> Oh, if you had just been there
>
> The swan was in her movements
>
> And the marvel in her smile
>
> All the roses in the garden
>
> They bow and ask her pardon
>
> For not one could match the beauty
>
> Of the queen of all Argyll

He is awe-struck and shares fervently in sheer admiration for the lady’s mannerisms and presence. She has the elegance
of swans, and the roses must bow in respect of her.
He humbly declares that she has beauty unmatched by anyone else. It is more than just physical beauty. It is by whom she
is in essence: full of elegance and charm.

> So my friends, I need must leave you
>
> My intentions not to grieve you
>
> Nor indeed would I deceive you
>
> Oh, I'll see you in a while
>
> I must find some way to see her
>
> To court her and to please her
>
> I fear my heart's in danger
>
> From the queen of all Argyll

What does the man do after sharing this? He leaves hastily, full of zealous, honorable ambition, dedicating his time
to finding a way to court her and cherish her. His mission is sincere and full of passion. He must find a way to court
her to love and cherish her.

## What I love about the music

The drums, keyboard, and piano sound passionate and full of noble ambition. Truly fitting for only the queen of Argyll.
I can hear the excitement when the singer shares the discovery of the lady. And one can feel in the fiddle with other
instruments, the grandiosity of the lady, and that is truly the highest of honors to be able to stand in witness of her.

I like the drums’ persistent beats. They sound full of confidence and are tight and sturdy, which gives the whole song a
solid structure to be in.

The guitar's soft strumming adds a gentle delicateness, which reflects the state of
vulnerability of the man.

The vocals are emotional and passionate, and one can feel the awe and vigor for the lady.

The keyboard’s clean playing guides the listener steadily through the man’s journey of discovery and courtship.

The fiddle
adds to the noble and grand feeling of discovering that special person.

The main quality I think that makes this song really great is that there is no fear or hesitation in the instrumentation
and
vocals. This makes the man’s intention pure and clear, and I respect and admire that of him.

## Conclusion

I really like the theme of passion and commitment in this song. This cover was genuine and passionate, and I prefer this
to the original. I rooted for the man and could sense his passion and admiration for the Queen through the lyrics,
instrumentation, and vocals. I hope one day I can develop such sincere and genuine feelings for someone, or for
something.
