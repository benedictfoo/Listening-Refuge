## Siobhan Miller—Queen of Argyll

This is a cover of a Silly Wizard song by Siobhan Miller, with some lyrics modified, in her latest
album Bloom.

The narrator, awe-struck and eager with a zealous passion, felt compelled to share, joyfully with everyone, a lady of "
character and feature", so remarkable that no words could even begin to describe her: the Queen of Argyll. This is
reflected in the gentle, clean, melodic acoustic guitars, tight, energetic percussion, and bright, cheery, emotional
piano chords.

He has total respect and admiration for her. She was special in his eyes - her gracefulness and beauty, like a swan; her
smile captivating, warm and
genuine. Even the roses in the garden have to bow to her.

No one in the whole of Argyll with its rich, large, and diverse population could match her splendor.  
The fiddle solo comes back to celebrate the marvel only found in her.

“The narrator left it to the listeners to find a respectful, honorable way to court her. The song concludes here with a
satisfying end, with the fiddle melody again,
but more subtle, and the same percussive drums and some cymbals.

It is rather inspiring that one could be passionate about someone they have just met with such vigor. It evokes in me a
sense of admiration for the narrator – he is such a gentleman and has a genuine and sincere love for her. He is
determined to win her over and love her with honor and respect.

I really enjoyed this song. Siobhan Miller's cover was genuine and passionate — I rooted for the narrator and could
sense his passion and admiration for the Queen through the lyrics, instrumentation and vocals. I hope one day I can
develop such sincere feelings for someone, for something, or for some calling. Hope you enjoyed today's post as much as
I enjoyed deeply dwelling on and absorbing this song.
