I had listened to some of Siobhan Miller’s earlier albums before this one—and enjoyed them—so *Bloom* wasn’t my first
encounter with her music. This album is mostly covers of popular folk songs, reimagined with a more modern, folk-pop
vibe. The first track, **“Queen of Argyll,”** is what got me hooked. It immediately caught my interest and set the tone
for the rest of the album.

Speaking of **“Queen of Argyll,”** it’s a cover of the Silly Wizard classic. From what I gathered in the lyrics, it’s a
song about the courtship of a fictional queen. On my first listen, I was surprised by the fiddle solo near the end—it
was really beautiful and grand. Not gonna lie, I repeated that part many times because it completely sucked me in. I
loved the instrumentation and vocals overall, and the fiddle solo was definitely my favorite.

This album gave off summery vibes that I deeply enjoyed. Most songs felt like perfect tens to me, but some of the slower
ones—like *“Star O’ the Bar”* and *“The Swan Swims Through”*—though rich in sound, were rather forgettable.

**Cold Blows the Rainy Night** is a fun and clever song about how a rainy night feels different when experienced from
both a woman’s and a man’s perspective (the man sleeps with her and then leaves). It’s rather poetic, and I appreciated
how it shows that our perception of the environment — like the weather — can change depending on our circumstances. I
liked how the song ends cheerily with the fiddle, making it lighthearted and encouraging acceptance to move on.

I’m not going to review every song, but some exceptional standouts were near the end, like **The Battle of Waterloo**, *
*Open All Night**, and **Saturday Night**. *The Battle of Waterloo*, with its sustaining cymbals, was a treat to the
ears, and together with the vocals, it invited a calm and introspective mood. *Open All Night* and *Saturday Night*
sounded somewhat similar, but they were fun and gave off vibes of being happy, free, and ready to enjoy the night — and
perhaps get some rest.

The album closes with *Wild Mountain Thyme*, which brings a peaceful and hopeful conclusion, as if leading the listener
to rest and recharge. But honestly, I was a little sad when the album ended — it was that good!

That’s it! It was a fun and thoroughly enjoyable album — peaceful, optimistic, and energetic, with moments to ponder
about self and the world. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
