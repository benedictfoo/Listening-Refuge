    <h1>Welcome to Tunequil Journal</h1>
    <p>This is a space where I reflect on songs that bring me comfort, clarity, or emotional release. Some calm me down,
        others lift me up â€” all of them help me feel more grounded.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m especially drawn to singer-songwriter and folk tunes, but I also dip into jazz, rock, indie pop and also
        other genres depending
        on the moment. It's not about genre â€” it's about the feeling.</p>
    <p>Thanks for being here. ðŸ˜Š</p>
