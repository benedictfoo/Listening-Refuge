    <h1>Hi â€” I'm Ben.</h1>
    <p>Music brings me comfort, clarity, and peace.</p>
    <p>
        This blog is a space where I reflect on songs that resonate with me â€”
        some bring calm, some offer emotional release, and others simply feel
        grounding in ways I canâ€™t always explain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Iâ€™m especially drawn to folk and blues, but I also find myself listening
        to jazz, rock, and indie pop. The sound might shift, but the feeling I
        look for is often the same: something honest, something steady.
    </p>
    <p>
        This isnâ€™t a place for music reviews. Itâ€™s more like a personal journal â€”
        a way to stay close to what Iâ€™m hearing, and what it brings up in me.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for being here.ðŸ˜Š</p>
