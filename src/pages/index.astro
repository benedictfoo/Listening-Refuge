    <h1>Hi â€” Iâ€™m Ben.</h1>
    <p>Music brings me comfort, clarity, and peace. This space is where I reflect on songs that resonate with me â€” some
        bring calm, some offer emotional release, and others simply feel grounding in ways I canâ€™t always explain.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m especially drawn to folk and blues â€” those honest, raw sounds that seem to speak straight to something
        inside. I also listen to jazz, rock, and indie pop when I need something lighter or brighter.</p>
    <p>This isnâ€™t about reviews or technical analysis. Itâ€™s more like a personal journal â€” capturing moments when music
        settles me, lifts me, or just sticks around in a meaningful way.</p>
    <p>Thanks for being here. ðŸ˜Š</p>
