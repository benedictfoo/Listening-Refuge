    <p class="mb-3.5">This is a space where I reflect on songs that bring me comfort, clarity, or emotional release.
        Some
        calm me down,
        others lift me up â€” all of them help me feel more grounded.</p>
    <p class="mb-3.5">Iâ€™m especially drawn to singer-songwriter and folk tunes, but I also dip into jazz, rock, indie
        pop
        and also
        other genres depending
        on the moment. It's not about genre â€” it's about the feeling.
