    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Ben ‚Äî a music lover who finds solace and clarity through songs. This blog, the <em>Tunequil Journal</em>,
        started as a personal space to hold onto the feelings music stirs in me.</p>
    <p>While I‚Äôm especially drawn to singer-songwriter and folk tunes for their honest storytelling and steady emotions,
        I also enjoy dipping into jazz, rock, indie pop, or any other genre depending on my mood. For me, it‚Äôs never
        just about the style ‚Äî it‚Äôs about the genuine feeling the music carries.</p>

    <h3>The Story Behind Tunequil Journal</h3>
    <p>The name <em>Tunequil</em> is a play on the word ‚Äútranquil,‚Äù reflecting how music brings calm and peace, creating
        a soothing space through melodies and moods.</p>

    <h3>Purpose of Tunequil Journal</h3>
    <p>I use this space to think about why certain songs make me feel good. Mostly for myself, but I hope it helps you
        get a sense of how I connect with music too.</p>

    <h3>A Little More About Me</h3>
    <p>Music has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs through quiet moments with
        headphones or sharing tunes with friends. I hope this journal not only captures my journey but also invites you
        to reflect on the songs that move you.</p>

    <p>Thanks for joining me here to explore the music that shapes these moments. üòä</p>
