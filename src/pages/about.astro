    <h2>Hi, I’m Ben</h2>
    <p>I’m a music lover who finds comfort in honest, calming songs and enjoys kettlebell workouts to stay balanced.
        These parts of my life help me find peace and joy every day.</p>

    <h2>What is Tunequil Journal?</h2>
    <p><em>Tunequil</em> is a play on the word “tranquil,” reflecting how music can create a soothing, peaceful space.
        This blog is my personal journal where I reflect on songs that resonate with me — the ones that bring calm,
        clarity, or a lift when I need it most.</p>

    <h2>What to Expect Here</h2>
    <p>This isn’t a place for reviews or technical music talk. Instead, it’s a space to explore the feelings music stirs
        up, why certain songs stick with me, and how they shape my mood and moments. I hope it invites you to connect
        with music in a personal way, too.</p>

    <h2>A Bit More About Me</h2>
    <p>Besides music, I love kettlebells — I’m no expert, but kettlebell swings help me unwind and stay healthy.
        Together, these interests keep me grounded and balanced.</p>
    <p>I used to be a hardcore rocker, but I realized it didn’t quite make me feel the way I wanted to feel. No offense
        to anyone — I still listen back sometimes for nostalgia and an energy boost.</p>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by and sharing this journey with me. 😊</p>
