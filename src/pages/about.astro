            <p> What music do you enjoy the most? Personally, I am drawn to songs that
                bring me comfort and healing, or gently help me grow.</p>

            <p>I'll be using this as a safe space to reflect on
                these songsâ€”to navigate through difficult emotions, to dive into moments of happiness, peace and joy;
                and to explore new perspectives I might carry into my life.</p>

            <p>I hope you enjoy some of the tunes shared here, and perhaps find the posts meaningful in some
                way.</p>
